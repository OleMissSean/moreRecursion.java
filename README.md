=================

Lab #9 (More Recursion) for CSci 112. I also taught this Lab. 

MORE RECURSION

Objectives:
  - Recursive search and sum

This lab will only need *ONE* class.

  1. Create an array that holds the numbers:
      2, 7, 3, 9, 10, 15, 4, 12, 20, 5, 17

  2. Write a recursive method that will sum the values held within the array. Print the sum.

  3. Write a recursive method that will Sequentially search the array for a number (this way you DO NOT have to sort the           array).
    - The numbers to look for are: 2, 12, 17, and 6. This will require separate calls to the method.
    - If the number is found return true, if not return false.
    - Test the returned value to print either the number was found or the number was not found.
